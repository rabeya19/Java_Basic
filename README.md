# Java Basic Project

Welcome to the Java Basic Project to starts with automation! This project is designed for automating tasks using Java. Below, you'll find instructions on setting up your development environment and getting started with the project.

## Prerequisites

Before begin, ensure that all the following prerequisites installed and configured:

1. **Java JDK 11:**

   - Download Java JDK 11 from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html).
   - You'll need to create an Oracle account if you don't have one already at [Oracle Account Creation](https://profile.oracle.com/myprofile/account/create-account.jspx).

2. **Java Environment Variable (JAVA_HOME):**

   - After installing the JDK, set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the JDK installation directory. This allows other tools and applications to locate your Java installation.

   - To verify the installation, open your command prompt and run:

     ```shell
     java --version
     ```

3. **Maven:**

   - Download and install Maven from [Maven Apache](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

4. **Maven Environment Variable (MAVEN_HOME):**

   - Set the `MAVEN_HOME` environment variable to the Maven installation directory.

   - To verify the installation, open your command prompt and run:

     ```shell
     mvn --version
     ```

5. **IDE for Java (Optional):**

   For a convenient development experience, I have used an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as [Spring Tools Suite](https://spring.io/tools).
